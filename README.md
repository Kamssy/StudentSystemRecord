Project Overview
The Student Record System is a C-based console application designed to manage basic academic data of students. It provides functionality to add, view, modify, delete, search, save, load, and sort student records. The project demonstrates practical implementation of fundamental C programming concepts such as:
1. Structures
2. Functions
3. Arrays & Loops
4. Dynamic Memory Allocation
5. File Handling
6. Input Validation

Objectives
. Build a functional Student Record System in C.
. Implement real-world programming concepts like dynamic memory and file operations.
. Provide a menu-driven application for managing student records.
. Ensure robust input validation and error handling.
. Practice teamwork and collaborative software development.
